# NoughtsN
Noughts 'n' crosses you can play in a shell.

The grid is numbered as follows:  

 1 | 2 | 3 
:-:|:-:|:-:
 4 | 5 | 6 
 7 | 8 | 9 

Enter the according number to place an 'X' in that space.

The opponent will employ basic noughts and crosses strategy, but is still non-optimal. Given its randomness, however, it is not unlikely for it to randomly play optimal strategy.
